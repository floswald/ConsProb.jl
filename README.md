# CAUTION: this repo is out of date. 

in fact, the most recent code does not work. there is a version that works burried somewhere in the tree, but that will only work with an old julia version. This repo is **ARCHIVED**. 
in short - **hands off this code**.

# INSTEAD: go checkout the new version of this!!!!!

new version is here: https://github.com/floswald/DCEGM.jl

# Consumption / Savings / Discrete Choice Problems

1. Installation
2. Standard Lifecycle Savings
3. Lifecycle Savings with discrete Retirement choice
4. License

## 1. Installation

```julia
# in Julia:
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/floswald/ConsProb.jl")
```

## 2. Standard Lifecycle Savings

this repo has `julia` code that computes the solution to a finite time savings problem with iid or AR1 income uncertainty using 3 different methods:

1. value function backward iteration
2. euler equation backward iteration
3. endogenous grid method

## 3. Lifecycle Savings with discrete Retirement choice

It also has julia implementation of the discrete choice model which is based on code from [Fedor Iskhakov's](https://github.com/fediskhakov/egdst) github. This implements the method in the [working paper by Iskhakov, Jorgensen, Rust and Schjerning](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17240700/sync4web/dcegm.pdf)

### Output Discrete Choice/Savings Model

In this section, dashed lines in a graph stand for an analytic solution in that region (i.e. no approximation to be done).
